<h1>Priorities</h1>
<p class="links"><a href="index.html">Meet Bernard</a> | <a href="priorities.html">Priorities</a> | <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/bernardparker22">Donate</a></p>
<p>Bernard's priority is to bring common sense to the legislative process especially in the budgeting area. Some examples that are really non-partisan:</p>
<p>-There are thousands of seniors on waiting lists to access services related to home health care and community health services. Last year the state and medicare spent 1.5 Billion dollars on nursing home costs. If they had increased the budget by a mere 20% to accomodate these seniors the state would actually have saved over 100 million dollars!!</p>

<p>-The legislature has failed to fully fund the Department of Children and
Family as well as the Guardian ad Litem program. Currently there are
over 30,000 children in dependency in Florida. Children in foster care
are more likely to drop out of high school and the most likely to be
incarcerated. By not providing all the services needed during foster
care we are not only alienating many youth and limiting their ability to
be productive tax-paying citizens but also incurring future tax-payer
liabilities in increased law enforcement and social services.</p>

<p>Bernard's political platform can be summarized by one word:
<strong>WH</strong>i<strong>Ch</strong></p>

<p>The main pillars of maintaining and growing Florida's economy are :
<strong>W</strong>ater, affordable <strong>H</strong>ousing and <strong>H</strong>ealthcare, and
<strong>Ch</strong>ildren's welfare and education.</p>

<p><strong>Water:</strong>Protect both our fresh and salt water. Use *Florida*
*Forever* funds to protect these resources by decreasing nitrate runoff
and salt water intrusion.</p>

<p><strong>Housing:</strong> Affordable housing is a necessity if we are to maintain and
grow our tourist economy. A person earning Florida's minimum wage would
have to work over 100 hours per week to afford a two bedroom apartment.
We must raise the minimum wage to at least $15 per hour. Given the
increased productivity of workers and inflation this wage should
actually be $22 per hour.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that in 1914 Henry Ford doubled the daily pay
of his factory workers to $5 per day. This enabled them not only to
purchase the cars they were producing (In 1916 a new Ford cost less than
$400!!) but to join the middle class and become tax paying citizens. In
2018 dollars that $5 per day equals $120 or $15 an hour!! We are only
104 years behind Mr. Ford!</p>

<p>The Sadowski Housing Trust Fund contains over $300 million dollars
generated by a tax paid on all real estate transactions in Florida.
These funds need to be fully allocated to the SHIP and SAIL programs
that enable counties to support affordable housing.</p>

<p><strong>Healthcare</strong>: It is a tragedy that our rich nation cannot provide
healthcare to all our citizens. In Florida children are
uninsured. Over 40% of the State's budget of 88 billion is consumed by
healthcare. Universal Medicare could eliminate costly middle men and
reduce prescription costs to the extent that the cost would likely be
little more than is currently spent.</p>

<p><strong>Children</strong>: There is no partisan debate that the welfare and education of
our children constitute the future prosperity of our nation. The monies
spent now are not costs but investments. Florida's public education
system needs to be supported fully. This past legislative session
increased funding by an embarrassing $0.49 per pupil! And yet the
private for profit schools received millions and with less
accountability than required in the public sector.</p>

<p>Teacher pay is another embarrassment. We are the third largest state in
the nation and yet our teachers rank 46th in pay and benefits. Even
Alabama pays its teachers more! We cannot recruit and retain the best
teachers without significantly increasing pay and benefits related to
job security and retirement.</p>

<p>Our post secondary institutions also need increased funding. Major
corporations examine graduation rates and the quality of professional
programs when they consider relocating to Florida. Excellent technical
training and community college programs are equally important in
providing the quality workforce that will grow the economy.</p>

<p>Florida's Lottery program was sold to the public as the salvation for
education . However, the legislature consistently underfunds public
education in part because of lottery dollars .</p>

<p>Bernard will support a bill legalizing recreational marijuana with a
hefty tax devoted exclusively to education. Sufficient provisos will
have to be included so that the monies generated will be utilized to
enhance public education rather than replace ordinary public funding.</p>

<p>None of the above will succeed without a safe and secure learning
environment. Increased counseling services and mental health support
need to be provided. We do not need to arm teachers or turn schools into
fortresses. Bernard will support a ban on assault weapons and high
capacity magazines; require a license to purchase and own a firearm;
require extensive background checks, training, and liability insurance
for gun owners.</p>
