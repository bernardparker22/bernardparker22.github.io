<p>Bernard's priority is to bring common sense to the legislative process especially in the budgeting area. Some examples that are really non-partisan:</p>
<p>-There are thousands of seniors on waiting lists to access services related to home health care and community health services. Last year the state and medicare spent 1.5 Billion dollars on nursing home costs. If they had increased the budget by a mere 20% to accomodate these seniors the state would actually have saved over 100 million dollars!!</p>
