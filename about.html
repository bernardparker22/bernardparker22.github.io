<p>For the past ten years he worked as a volunteer with Habitat for Humanity. In 2002​ he joined VISTA (Volunteer in Service to America – the same as Peace Corp but service performed in the US rather than abroad) and spent the next year and a few months working full time with Habitat for Humanity on a special project. At the conclusion of his VISTA service Bernard became involved with Habitat's Global Village program as a senior team leader. Over the next ten years he led teams of 10 to 12 volunteers to construct homes in 20 different third world countries like Mongolia, Ethiopia, Uganda, Paraguay, Chile, Nepal, etc. <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/aging/lifetimes/retired-college-professor-took-habitat-teams-to-16-countries/2181522">Click here to read an article in the St. Petersburg Times about Bernard&#39s travels with Habitat.</a></p>
